# Household Electricity Usage Analysis

This project explores household electricity usage data as a way to practice writing clean, organized, and modular data science code.

### üìÅ Project Structure

- **1_data_cleaning.ipynb**  
  Handles missing values, data type corrections, and basic cleanup.

- **2_eda.ipynb**  
  Performs exploratory data analysis with visualizations and summary statistics.

- **3_preprocessing_feature_engineering.ipynb**  
  Prepares the data for modeling by creating meaningful features and applying transformations using techniques like correlation matrices.

- **4_model.ipynb**  
  Trains machine learning models to analyze or predict electricity consumption patterns.

- **5_anomaly_detection.ipynb**  
  Detects unusual consumption behavior using statistical methods or machine learning models.

### üîß Tools Used
